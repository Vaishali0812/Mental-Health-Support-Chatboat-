When we are stressed, we usually know what we're stressed about, and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over. Anxiety, on the other hand, isn't always as easy to figure out. Anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us, as well as anxiety about the anxiety itself. Stress and anxiety are both part of being human, but both can be problems if they last for a long time or have an impact on our well-being or daily life.","['whats', 'the', 'difference', 'between', 'anxiety', 'and', 'stress']","['stress', 'and', 'anxiety', 'are', 'often', 'used', 'interchangeably', 'and', 'there', 'is', 'overlap', 'between', 'stress', 'and', 'anxiety', 'stress', 'is', 'related', 'to', 'the', 'same', 'fight', 'flight', 'or', 'freeze', 'response', 'as', 'anxiety', 'and', 'the', 'physical', 'sensations', 'of', 'anxiety', 'and', 'stress', 'may', 'be', 'very', 'similar', 'the', 'cause', 'of', 'stress', 'and', 'anxiety', 'are', 'usually', 'different', 'however', 'stress', 'focuses', 'on', 'mainly', 'external', 'pressures', 'on', 'us', 'that', 'were', 'finding', 'hard', 'to', 'cope', 'with', 'when', 'we', 'are', 'stressed', 'we', 'usually', 'know', 'what', 'were', 'stressed', 'about', 'and', 'the', 'symptoms', 'of', 'stress', 'typically', 'disappear', 'after', 'the', 'stressful', 'situation', 'is', 'over', 'anxiety', 'on', 'the', 'other', 'hand', 'isnt', 'always', 'as', 'easy', 'to', 'figure', 'out', 'anxiety', 'focuses', 'on', 'worries', 'or', 'fears', 'about', 'things', 'that', 'could', 'threaten', 'us', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'anxiety', 'about', 'the', 'anxiety', 'itself', 'stress', 'and', 'anxiety', 'are', 'both', 'part', 'of', 'being', 'human', 'but', 'both', 'can', 'be', 'problems', 'if', 'they', 'last', 'for', 'a', 'long', 'time', 'or', 'have', 'an', 'impact', 'on', 'our', 'wellbeing', 'or', 'daily', 'life']",7,152,-0.9808,-0.9808,negative
